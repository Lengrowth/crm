Status: working inventory for `PLAT-P0`; no secret values belong here.

## Repositories and source

| Champion forecast / commercial plan | `https://github.com/guerra2fernando/champion-forecast.git` | local checkout has unrelated dirty changes; preserve them |

## Runtime and ownership

- Temporary implementation hostname: `erp.lengrowth.com`; final Champion domain is not selected.
- Control-plane product and service URLs must come from environment/site configuration.
- AWS EC2 and Cloudflare zone are verified; three temporary hostnames are proxied through Cloudflare to the EC2 origin. The public API edge TLS configuration is still failing and requires DNS/SSL-capable Cloudflare access.
- Production SSH inventory completed read-only. Frappe/ERPNext source trees are dirty; no upstream source was changed by this run.
- Reproducible staging-lane contract: `ops/staging/`; control-plane and ERP staging host/service/database/file evidence is established on the EC2 with private host-header checks.

## Release artifacts

- Immutable candidate builder: `scripts/release/build_candidate.sh`.
- Non-secret release manifest builder: `scripts/release/build_manifest.py`.
- Staging deployment: `scripts/deploy/deploy_saas_control.sh`.
- Explicit production promotion: `scripts/deploy/promote_saas_control.sh`.
- Preflight and smoke checks: `scripts/release/preflight.sh`, `scripts/release/smoke.sh`.
- Upstream source guard: `scripts/release/verify_upstream_clean.sh`.
- Secret scan: `scripts/release/secret_scan.py`.

## Data and recovery

- Site database, site configuration, public files, private files, and control-plane database must never be committed.
- Backup destination is Cloudflare R2 bucket `lenerp-phase0-backups`; ERP/control-plane artifacts were uploaded and byte-hash verified. Retention, automation credential owner, and second restore operator remain open.
- The ERP SQL dump restored into disposable MariaDB schema `plat_p0_restore_20260915` with 707 tables; the temporary schema was removed after verification.
- The disposable ERP staging site is `erp-staging.example.test` under `/opt/frappe-staging-bench`; control-plane staging is under `/opt/saas-control-staging`. Their databases, files, Redis ports, services, and workers are separate from production.
- No Champion confidential data may be received, restored, copied, or imported before credential rotation and plaintext-secret resolution are complete.
